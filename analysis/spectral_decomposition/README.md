For accelerating the computations, we used a multi-GPU machine (configurations as specified in the [README](https://github.com/sayakpaul/robustness-vit/blob/master/README.md)) for this experiment. But the notebook in this directory can directly be run inside a Colab Notebook.

We thank Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez for helpful discussions on this experiment. Guillermo is the first author of the paper ([Hold me tight! Influence of discriminative features on deep network boundaries](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1ea97de85eb634d580161c603422437f-Abstract.html)) on which this experiment is based.
